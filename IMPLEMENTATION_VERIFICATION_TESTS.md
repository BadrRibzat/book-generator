# Book Generator Testing Guide (Updated)

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for testing the book generation flow and validating that all fixes have been properly implemented.

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure the backend server is running:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. Ensure the frontend development server is running:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

## Test Scenario 1: Book Creation & Auto-Polling

This test verifies that book creation works and that the auto-polling mechanism keeps users in the profile workspace during generation.

### Steps:

1. **Login to your account**
   - Navigate to `/auth/signin`
   - Enter your credentials
   - Verify you are redirected to the profile page

2. **Create a new book**
   - Navigate to `/profile/create` or click "Create Book" button
   - Select a domain (e.g., "Tech & AI")
   - Select a sub-niche (e.g., "AI Ethics")
   - Choose a page length (e.g., 15 pages)
   - Click "Generate Book"

3. **Verify auto-polling works**
   - You should be taken to the book details page
   - Confirm the status indicator shows "Generating Content"
   - Watch the page for 10-20 seconds
   - **Expected**: The page should refresh automatically without you having to reload
   - **Expected**: You should NOT be redirected away from the profile area
   - **Expected**: After 30-60 seconds (depending on server load), the status should change

4. **Check browser console**
   - Open browser developer tools (F12)
   - Go to Console tab
   - **Expected**: No errors containing "NaN" should appear
   - **Expected**: No 404 errors for API calls

## Test Scenario 2: Cover Selection

This test verifies that the cover selection process works correctly after content generation.

### Steps:

1. **Wait for content generation**
   - On the book details page, wait until the status changes to "Content Ready"
   - A "Choose Cover Now" button should appear

2. **Select a cover**
   - Click the "Choose Cover Now" button
   - **Expected**: You should be redirected to the cover selection page
   - Verify that 3 cover options are displayed
   - Click on one of the covers to select it
   - Click "Confirm Selection"

3. **Verify successful selection**
   - **Expected**: You should be redirected back to the book details page
   - The status should now show "Ready to Download"
   - The selected cover should be displayed
   - A download button should be available

4. **Check browser console again**
   - **Expected**: No errors related to NaN or undefined IDs

## Test Scenario 3: Download PDF

This test verifies that the final PDF download works correctly.

### Steps:

1. **Download the book**
   - On the book details page with "Ready to Download" status
   - Click the "Download PDF" button
   - **Expected**: A PDF file should download
   - Open the PDF and verify it contains both the cover and content

## Test Scenario 4: Edge Cases

This test verifies that error handling works correctly.

### Steps:

1. **Test invalid book ID**
   - Manually navigate to `/books/abc` (non-numeric ID)
   - **Expected**: You should be redirected to the books list
   - **Expected**: No errors in console about NaN

2. **Test nonexistent book ID**
   - Navigate to `/books/9999` (assuming ID 9999 doesn't exist)
   - **Expected**: You should see a proper error message
   - **Expected**: No unhandled exceptions or blank screens

## Test Scenario 5: API Verification

This test verifies that the API returns all expected fields.

### Steps:

1. **Check API responses**
   - Open browser developer tools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Navigate to your book details page (e.g., `/books/1`)
   - Find the API call to `/api/books/1/`
   - Click on it and examine the response

2. **Verify fields**
   - **Expected**: The response should include:
     - `id`
     - `title`
     - `domain`
     - `sub_niche`
     - `page_length`
     - `status`
     - `created_at`
     - `updated_at`
     - `content_generated_at`
     - `completed_at`
     - `covers` (array)
     - `selected_cover` (object or null)
     - `can_download`
     - `download_url`
     - `error_message`
     - `user_username`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during testing:

1. **Console Errors**:
   - Check browser console (F12) for detailed errors
   - Look for network request failures

2. **Backend Errors**:
   - Check Django terminal for Python exceptions
   - Look for HTTP status codes in network requests

3. **Common Issues**:
   - **"NaN" in URL**: May indicate the safe ID conversion isn't working
   - **Stuck on "Generating"**: May indicate an issue with the polling mechanism
   - **Missing fields in UI**: Could be serializer issues or component problems

## Reporting Issues

If you find any bugs or issues, please document:

1. The exact steps to reproduce the issue
2. Screenshots of any error messages
3. Browser console logs (if applicable)
4. Network requests showing the problem (if applicable)

Happy Testing!
