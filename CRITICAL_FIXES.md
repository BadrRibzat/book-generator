# CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED

## Immediate Issues:

### 1. 403 Forbidden Error
**Cause**: Frontend server not restarted after proxy configuration
**Fix**: 
```bash
# Stop frontend (Ctrl+C)
cd /home/badr/book-generator/frontend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Router Warning (Minor)
The `/books` warning is likely from a failed navigation attempt. Routes are correct.

### 3. Missing FontAwesome Icons
Need to check which icons are missing and register them in main.ts

## Vision Implementation Plan:

### Phase 1: Book Generation Flow âœ…
- [x] User selects niche
- [x] User selects page length
- [x] Backend generates content
- [x] Book created in database

### Phase 2: PDF Preview (NO DOWNLOAD) ðŸš§
- [ ] After book generation completes
- [ ] Display PDF preview in browser (using PDF.js or iframe)
- [ ] **READ-ONLY** - no download button
- [ ] "Continue to Cover Selection" button

### Phase 3: Cover Selection Interface ðŸš§
- [ ] Backend generates 3 cover options based on:
  - Book title
  - Sub-niche
  - Domain/category
- [ ] Frontend displays 3 covers in a grid
- [ ] Simple preview/selection interface (like Canva)
- [ ] User MUST select one cover to proceed
- [ ] "Regenerate Covers" option available

### Phase 4: Final Assembly âœ…
- [ ] Backend merges selected cover with interior PDF
- [ ] Status changes to "ready"
- [ ] **NOW** download button appears
- [ ] User gets complete, publish-ready book

## Next Steps:

1. **Fix 403 Error**: Restart frontend
2. **Test book creation**: Verify it reaches backend
3. **Implement PDF preview**: Add Books/Details.vue with PDF viewer
4. **Implement cover selection**: Add cover generation + selection UI

## Key SaaS Feature:
**No download until cover is selected** - This is your value proposition!
- Free content generation
- Must select professional cover
- Forces users to complete the workflow
- Guarantees publish-ready product
