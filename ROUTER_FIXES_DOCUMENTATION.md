# Router Path Standardization Fix

## Issue
Users were experiencing redirect issues during the book generation flow:
1. Being redirected outside the profile workspace
2. Getting NaN IDs in URLs causing 404 errors 
3. Navigation paths inconsistency between `/books/` and `/profile/books/`

## Root Cause Analysis
The application had mixed usage of URL paths, with some components using `/books/:id` and others using `/profile/books/:id` for the same resources. This inconsistency caused:

1. Users leaving the profile workspace when navigating
2. NaN errors when IDs were not properly converted from strings to numbers
3. Router warnings about missing routes

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Router Configuration
- Added dual route definitions in `router/index.ts`:
  - `/profile/books/:id` - Primary route (recommended)
  - `/books/:id` - Legacy route (for backward compatibility)

### 2. Component Updates
- Updated router links in all book-related components:
  - SelectCover.vue
  - Details.vue
  - List.vue

### 3. Redirect Logic
- Updated all redirects to use the `/profile/` prefix:
  - After cover selection: `/profile/books/${id}`
  - After book deletion: `/profile/books`
  - When invalid ID is detected: `/profile/books`

### 4. Safe ID Handling
- Maintained safe ID conversion in components:
  ```typescript
  const bookId = computed(() => {
    const id = parseInt(props.id);
    return isNaN(id) ? 0 : id;
  });
  ```
- Added redirection for NaN IDs

## Verification
- Created a verification script `verify_routing_fixes.sh` to check for:
  - Proper route configuration in router/index.ts
  - Correct usage of `/profile/books` links in all components
  - Proper redirection after cover selection
  - Any remaining `/books/` links that might need review

## Testing
The fixes can be tested by:
1. Creating a new book and following the generation flow
2. Selecting a cover and checking that the user remains in the profile workspace
3. Manually navigating to `/books/:id` to verify the backward compatibility

## Future Considerations
- We've kept the legacy `/books/:id` routes for backward compatibility, but they should be phased out over time
- Any new features should exclusively use the `/profile/books/:id` route pattern
